## Features
- **Image thumbnail navigation**: browse through thumbnails of images and click to view them in full size.
- **Full size image viewing**: view images in a modal overlay with its captions.

### Prerequisites
- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Microsoft Edge)
- A code editor (e.g., VS code, Sublime Text)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
	```sh
	git clone https://github.com/N-benitha/Photo-Gallery.git
	```
2. Navigate to the project directory
	```sh
	cd Photo-Gallery
	```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser:
	```sh
	open index.html
	```
	or use a live server extension in your code editor for a better development experience

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the gallery.

- `index.css`: The CSS file that contains styling for the gallery. This was based on the [Figma]() designs provided as a visual reference for  implementing the gallery.

- `index.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the functionality for the gallery. My JS code ensures readability and consistency through the use of iteration, allowing the user to add more photos to the gallery without the need for redundant code.

- `images/`: A directory that contains the images displayed in the gallery.

## Usage
To use the photo gallery, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browse. Click on any thumbnail to view the image in full size. Use the close button to return to the gallery.
